# React Native Design Lab ðŸ§ªðŸ”¬

A collection of **React Native projects** focused on **UI design and layout experiments**.  
These projects are built mainly for **learning purposes**, **design exploration**, and **content creation** (YouTube/TikTok/Instagram tutorials).

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Explore **mobile UI concepts** in React Native.
- Recreate and experiment with **modern app designs** (from Dribbble, Behance, etc.).
- Serve as a **learning playground** without focusing too much on backend or complex functionality.

## ðŸ“± What to Expect
- Minimal functionality (design-first approach).
- Examples of **navigation patterns**, **animations**, and **responsive layouts**.
- Components styled with **Expo**, **React Native**, and modern libraries.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo and run any design project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toniocode/react-native-design-lab.git
cd [project-name]
npm install
npx expo start
